# PyTeslaBLE
Python library for communicating with Tesla vehicles directly using the BLE API

:bangbang: | WARNING: This library is not supported by Tesla, and it could break at any moment. It should be noted that this library stores private keys and other sensitive data unencrypted on your machine. I am not responsible for any (extremely unlikely) damage done to your car.
:---: | :---

## Usage
`pip install pyteslable`

```python
from pyteslable import BLE
tesla_ble = BLE("private_key.pem")

print("Scanning for vehicles...")
list = tesla_ble.scan()
print(list)

# Connect to a specific vehicle by BLE address
vehicle = list.getAddress("05:eb:6d:b7:f7:92")
vehicle.connect()
if not vehicle.isAdded():
  print("Tap your keycard on the center console")
  vehicle.whitelist()
# Now we are ready to send commands!
vehicle.unlock()
```

## Cryptography Library Modification
If you have the latest `cryptography` library, you will likely get an error about not supporting 4-bit nonces.
For now, the best solution I have is to simply modify the if statement that produces the error.

## Credits
Huge props to Lex Nastin for putting together some documentation for the Tesla BLE API. Check out the documentation [here](https://teslabtapi.lexnastin.com/).

Also many thanks to Kevin Dewald from Neuralink for the [BLE library](https://github.com/OpenBluetoothToolbox/SimpleBLE)!

## Building for local development

To build a package to add to `pip` locally, run `python3 -m build`.

To then install the package to `pip`, run `pip3 install ./dist/pyteslable-0.1.4.tar.gz`
